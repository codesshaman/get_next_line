Dmitri Ivanovich Mendeleev was a Russian chemist and inventor. He is best known for formulating the
Periodic Law and creating a farsighted version of the periodic table of elements. He used the 
Periodic Law not only to correct the then-accepted properties of some known elements, such as
the valence and atomic weight of uranium, but also to predict the properties of three elements
that were yet to be discovered.
