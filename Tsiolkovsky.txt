Konstantin Eduardovich Tsiolkovsky was a Russian and Soviet rocket scientist who pioneered astronautic theory.
Along with the Frenchman Robert Esnault-Pelterie, the Transylvanian German Hermann Oberth and the American Robert H. Goddard,
he is one of the founding fathers of modern rocketry and astronautics.[2][3] His works later inspired leading Soviet
rocket-engineers Sergei Korolev and Valentin Glushko who contributed to the success of the Soviet space program.
