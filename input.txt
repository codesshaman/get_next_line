He was the first scientist to explain mathematically the origin of aerodynamic lift, through his circulation hypothesis,
the first to establish that the lift force generated by a body moving through an ideal fluid is proportional to the velocity
and the circulation around the body. He used a conformal mathematical transformation to define the ideal shape of the aerodynamic
profile having as essential elements a rounded nose (leading edge), double surface (finite thickness), cambered or symmetrical,
and a sharp tail (trailing edge). He built the first wind tunnel in Russia. He was also responsible for the eponymous water hammer
equation used by civil engineers and the Joukowsky transform.
